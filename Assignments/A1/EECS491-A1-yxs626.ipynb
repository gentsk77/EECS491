    "  As we can see from the four trials above, variating the entries of $p(K|B,M)$ by $1/3$ contributes to the same extent of variance to the fianl result we get. Therefore, all four are the factors that contributed to the value, or in other words, none of the entires is the main factor that affects the value.  \n",
